# Contributing to Terraform Live Graph Extension for VSCode
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If seen as necessary, update the documentation.
3. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact [@adamiBs](https://github.com/adamiBs) if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/adamiBs/vscode-terraform-live-graph/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/adamiBs/vscode-terraform-live-graph/issues/new/choose); it's that easy!
